VPC is the virtual network on the cloud, dedicated to your account. 
Every VPC has a range of IPs allocated in form of CIDR. 
The range of these IPs can be split further between subnets of the VPC. 
A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine the destination of the network traffic
An Internet Gateway facilicates communication between the instances in VPC and the internet. 
A VPC endpoint enables connection of the VPC resources to the AWS services without internet using PrivateLink
